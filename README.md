# water-probability-classifier
Developed a machine learning model to predict water potability using physicochemical properties such as pH, hardness, and dissolved solids. Implemented data preprocessing, feature scaling, and classification algorithms using Python and Scikit-Learn.
# OVERVIEW
This project aims to predict the concentration levels of six key water pollutants using historical environmental monitoring data. By utilizing machine learning, it helps forecast pollution trends at different water monitoring stations based on the year of interest.

# POLLUTANTS PREDICTED:

- **O2 (Oxygen)**
- **NO3 (Nitrate)**
- **NO2 (Nitrite)**
- **SO4 (Sulfate)**
- **PO4 (Phosphate)**
- **CL (Chloride)**

 # TECHNOLOGIES USED
 - **python** - 3.11
 - **Scikit-learn** — Model building (RandomForest + MultiOutputRegressor)
 - **pandas / numpy**— Data cleaning & transformation
 - **Joblib**— Model serialization  
 - **Streamlit** — Web app for deployment.
 - **Metrics** — MSE, R² Score for evaluation.

# DATA PREPROCESSING:
- **Loading Data**
- **Date Parsing & Sorting**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Handling Missing Values**
- **Feature Encoding**

- 
# DEPLOYMENT:
- **Saved trained model using joblib to pollution_model.pkl.**
- **Saved the list of model input columns to model_columns.pkl for reproducible inference.**


# MODEL:
- **Multi-Output Regression and**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
